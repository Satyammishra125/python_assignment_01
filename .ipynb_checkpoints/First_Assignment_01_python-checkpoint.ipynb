    "## Question 1.Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n",
    "There are some key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming. \n",
    "they are :\n",
    "1. Simple and Readable Syntax:\n",
    "    -> Python's syntax is clear and so simple, which make it accessible for \n",
    "    beginners. It emphasizes readability and reduces the complexity of \n",
    "    writing and maintaning code.\n",
    "2. High-Level Language:\n",
    "    -> Python abstracts away much of the complexity involved in memory\n",
    "    management and lower-level programming tasks. This allows developers \n",
    "    to focus more on solving problems rather than managing the \n",
    "    intricacies of the hardware.\n",
    "3. Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "    -> Python uses dynamic type, which means we don't have to declare the\n",
    "    type of a variable when you create it. This feature speed up to make \n",
    "    the code easier to write and read.\n",
    "4. Interpreted Language:\n",
    "    -> Python is an interpreted language, meaning it executes code line by line,\n",
    "    which makes debugging and testing faster.\n",
    "5. Vast Library:\n",
    "    ->Python Programming Language have a lot of libraries more than\n",
    "    1,37,000 libraries which are used in Machine Learning, Data Implementation,\n",
    "    Data Science, Data Manipulation and Visualisation and more.\n",
    "6. Community and Ecosystem:\n",
    "    -> Python has a large and active community that contributes to a \n",
    "    vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks. Tools like \n",
    "    NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Django extend Python’s functionality \n",
    "    and make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from \n",
    "    web development to data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Versatility:->\n",
    "    Python is used in various domains, including web development (Django, Flask), data science and machine learning (Pandas, Scikit-Learn), automation (Selenium, scripts), and even game development (Pygame). Its versatility makes it a valuable tool for many different types of projects.\n",
    "8.  Object-oriented and Functional Programming:->\n",
    "    Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their particular needs.\n",
    "9.  Strong Integration Capabilities:->\n",
    "    Python can easily interface with other languages like C/C++ and Java, as well as with various APIs and systems. This makes it possible to integrate Python with other technologies and leverage existing codebases.\n",
    "10. Education Value:-> \n",
    "    Python is often used as a first programming language in educational settings due to its simplicity and readability. Learning Python provides a solid foundation for understanding more complex programming concepts and languages.\n",
    "11. Cross-Platform Compatibility:->\n",
    "    Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform nature ensures that Python code can run on different operating systems with minimal modification.\n",
    "### These features make widely usable and popular in all over world.\n",
    "    "

    "## Question 3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
